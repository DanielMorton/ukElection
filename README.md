# ukElection
This started with anecdotal observation I made during the 2015 UK general election. Many, if not most, of the seats in the south of England were not only safe Conservative seats, but Labour didn't even come in second.  Looking back at 2010, I saw that the Liberal Democrats were usually the second party, but by 2015 they had collapsed and were increasingly being replaced by UKIP. Nonetheless, it was clear that for large swaths of the country, especially in the south, the election was not a direct contest between the two major parties.

Was this a general rule? It was hard to tell just by sampling from the map. Even though most of the electoral map in England is blue, that just means Conservative seats dominate by area. I needed the full data to be sure.

The BBC stil has election results online going back at least to 2001. I used the Scrapy package to write scrapers for 2010 and the combined 2015 and 2017 election results. (See the uk2010 and uk2015 folders.) I was only able to find 2015 and 2017 election maps from Ordinance Survey. Overall, my original assessment was borne out for 2010 and 2015, but the snap election of 2017 saw a return to two party competition.
